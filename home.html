      <h2> Below is some basic information about myself, and where you can
        navigate throughout my first web page. </h2>
      <p> Thank you for visiting my web page.  I am currently and transfer student 
        attending Umass Lowell pursuing my Computer Science degree.  I took this 
        class because I was interested in getting an understanding of how to make
        websites.  I took one "website builder" class in high school and it really 
        got my attention.  I look forward to learning more about HTML and CSS as we
        move through the course. </p>
      <p> If you haven't noticed, there is a navigation bar at the top of this home
        page.  Please click on those links to learn a little bit more about me and
        what I do.  </p>
