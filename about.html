  - This web page is my first web page, yet a bit more detailed.  
  It has four sections now; the index, about me, contact me, and an assignment
  section.  I have applied multiple fonts and colors throughout
  my website, in addition to the navigation bar and assignments section.

      Consistency is key!-->

    <!--For the most part, each one of my pages has specific body content that
        I wanted to design separately.  That is what this tag does.-->

    <p>  Hello everyone, my name is Joshua Blanchette, and I am a CS transfer student
         here at Umass Lowell.  Before I attended Umass Lowell, I went to Middlesex
         Community College, where I got my Associates Degree in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I know a couple of programming languages; Java being my strong point.  I also
         am taking a C++ class here at UML.  I really look forward to learning and 
         expanding my little knowledge that I have of HTML and CSS. </p>
    <p>In my spare time, I love to play video games, snowmobile and spend time with family.
         We usually rent a cabin up in Pittsburgh, New Hampshire every winter and enjoy the
         snow for a while.  In the summer I like to go boating and lounge in the sun. 
         This usually only happens on the weekend because of my internship during that time,
         but that's okay. </p>
    <p>I work at a company called Firebrand Technologies.  They help book publishers get
         their titles out to the public in a nice, orderly fashion.  I tested all their releases for new 
         clients before we sent it to them.  I had an awesome time working there and am 
         looking forward to head back there for the summer. </p>
